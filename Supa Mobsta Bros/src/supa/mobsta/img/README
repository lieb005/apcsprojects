In this directory needs to be the pictures
of the characters and the pallette(s)

The Characters can either have multiple pictures
	ie: tux1.png, tux2.png, ...

The Pallette must be a 16x5 grid of textures.  They
must all be squares (8x8 or 32x32 maybe).  They will
be shrunk to ~8x8, so they will lose detail if large.

Read codes.txt for ordering of the tiles and Example.wld
for how they are addressed.

There also needs to be individual images for all of the characters.
These must be the same size as the tiles (same multiples, ie tile width = 32 and
player width = 32n, ...)
These must contain the different states of the characters like this:

____________
|      __\/|
|    __\/\/|
|  __\/\/\/|
|__\/\/\/\/|
+----------+
__________
| __  __ |
|/oo\/oo\|
|/ /  \ \|
