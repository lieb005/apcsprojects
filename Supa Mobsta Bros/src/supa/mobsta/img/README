In this directory needs to be the pictures
of the characters and the pallette(s)

The Characters can either have multiple pictures
    ie: tux1.png, tux2.png, ...

The Pallette must be a 16x5 grid of textures.  They
must all be squares (8x8 or 32x32 maybe).  They will
be shrunk to ~8x8, so they will lose detail if large.

Read codes.txt for ordering of the tiles and Example.wld
for how they are addressed.

There also needs to be a pallette of Enemies, but that can
just be a single height image like:
